## 5. Storytelling

The EDA is structured as a narrative journey, answering key questions:

1.  **The Rise of Nations:** An animated bar chart race shows how different countries accumulated Nobel Prizes over time, highlighting the rise of the USA post-WWII.
2.  **The Gender Gap:** Visualizations explore the historical underrepresentation of women and the categories where they have made the most progress.
3.  **Age of Discovery:** An animated histogram reveals how the age of laureates has shifted over the decades, suggesting that breakthroughs now take longer.
4.  **US Dominance:** A detailed look at the proportion of US-born winners over time.
5.  **Global Map:** A choropleth map provides a geographical overview of where laureates originate.
